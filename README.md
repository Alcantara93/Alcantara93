Hello, I am Ailton.
Iâ€™ve spent the last four years intensely engrained in the world of data, finding joy in the challenge of transforming data into strategic insights that drive business decisions and growth. My expertise lies in dissecting complex datasets and translating them into clear, actionable intelligence for stakeholders at all levels.

What makes me valuable to businesses is my blend of data science and business analysis expertise. My analytical prowess is complemented by a strong business acumen, enabling me to not only identify trends but also to understand their potential impact on the business.

As a Business Analyst at DvaClean Ltd, I demonstrated expertise in statistical modelling and design, predictive analytics, data visualisation/interpretation, as well as reporting using Power BI and Tableau. I utilised Python programming language in developing predictive models that improved decision-making processes and consequently increased operational efficiency by 30%. 

In my data science apprenticeship at the University of Bedfordshire, I was pivotal in performing comprehensive data analysis using Python and R, as well as strengthening data architecture and governance. 

My focus is on developing algorithms that not only predict trends but also drive actionable business decisions. This forward-thinking mindset has been instrumental in my success, as evidenced by the process improvements I've spearheaded that have directly enhanced the bottom line.

I am committed to staying at the forefront of technology, currently pursuing a Master of Business Management with a focus on business analytics. Going forward, I am looking to continue pushing the boundaries of what data can achieve in a business context to foster growth and innovation.
